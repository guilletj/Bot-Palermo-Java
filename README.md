# Bot Palermo

One of the results of my boredom is this.
A Discord bor coded using [Discord JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) for my friends' server.
I keep this here just for "historical purpose", so no updates or support will be provided.
You may reuse this code as you want, but notice that you'll need to modify some hard coded stuff since this bot wasn't intended to be public.
